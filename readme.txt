A simple plugin to create and show timeline.

== Description ==

A timeline plugin for wordpress. 
This plugin is deigned and developed for real functional requirements. Firstly I tried to look for a published pulgin.
However,most of them seems huge and plump. Considering the status of my website, I decided to develop a light and simple
plugin which doesn't relay on too much third party libraries and reduce the speed of website.
The target of this plugin is to provide a simple way to create timeline and show on wordpress based website.
About the front-end performance, I must show my appreciation to 三生石上 since I get idea from his blog (http://www.cnblogs.com/sanshi/p/3229220.html).

To reduce tranffic request in front-end, I don't add any js and only one css file will be loaded when initinitialization.


== Installation ==


1. Upload all unziped files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place [stl-show-timeline] shortcode in your post/page.
