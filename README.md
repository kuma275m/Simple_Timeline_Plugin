Simple_Timeline_Plugin
======================

A timeline plugin for wordpress. 
This plugin is deigned and developed for real functional requirements. 
The target of this plugin is to provide a simple way to create timeline and show on wordpress based website.
About the front-end performance, I must show my appreciation to 三生石上 since I get idea from his blog (http://www.cnblogs.com/sanshi/p/3229220.html).

To reduce tranffic request in front-end, I don't add any js and only one css file will be loaded when initinitialization.
